According to the BIP47 document, the following core functionality is required:

Generate payment code from seed
Initialize a payment code from base58 payment code
Derive notification addresses
Derive public keys from a payment code and a notification private key
Derive public keys from a payment code and a notification public key
Derive P2PKH addresses from a payment code and notification private key
Derive P2Pkh addresses from a payment code and notification public key

Fortunately, Dojo full node source code has implemented all the above functionally. Specifically in these projects bip-47-tool and bip47-js.
We could directly make use of bip47-js functions and use the bip47-tool project to double-check our implementation. We may implement any other behavioral functionality that we may need independently.

We will be able to derive BIP-47 compatible addresses from BIP-39 Mnemonic Seeds which should be enough to enable portability among other wallets like SamuraiWallet.

Paynyms which are implemented by SamuraiWallet will not be implemented here. Instead, users will be able to simply share their unique “Payment Code”. If paynym-like behavior is desired, a separate public directory needs to be developed.
