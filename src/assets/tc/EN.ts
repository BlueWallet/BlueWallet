<h3>
    ABOUT THE APPLICATIONS AND YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES
</h3>
<p>
    The Application is software that generates Wallet addresses that you may use to send and receive Bitcoin Vault (“BTCV”) tokens (the “BTCV tokens”). 
    You must keep your Wallet address, seed phrase, and private key access information secure. Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of BTCV tokens associated with the Wallet. 
</p>
<p>
    The Applications cannot assist with password retrieval. The Applications stores your Wallet address but does not receive or store your Wallet password, encrypted private key, unencrypted private key, or seed phrase associated with your Wallet. We cannot, therefore, assist you with Wallet password retrieval. We cannot generate a new password for your Wallet if you fail to remember your original password. 
</p>
<p>
    If you have not safely stored a backup of any Wallet address and private key pairs maintained in your Wallet, you accept and acknowledge that any BTCV tokens you have associated with such a Wallet address will become inaccessible if you do not have your Wallet password. 
</p>
<p>
    You represent and warrant that any information you provide via the Products is accurate and complete. You accept and acknowledge that we are not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any BTCV tokens transaction initiated via the Products. We strongly encourage you to review your transaction details carefully before attempting to transfer a BTCV tokens.
</p>
<p>
    When you start using the Application you must either import or create a Wallet in order to use the Application. You will be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your private key and seed phrase, and will be fully responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. 
</p>
<p>
    You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password, account, or any other breach of security, however we will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this respect. When you create a Wallet, you are strongly advised to take precautions in order to avoid loss of access to and/or control over your Wallet. 
</p>
<p>
    You must ensure that you have an adequate balance in your Wallet and/or gas to complete transactions before initiating a transaction. You acknowledge and agree that we will not be liable for any failed transactions due to insufficient funds or gas associated with your Wallet account. 
</p>
<p>
    It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions that you have submitted transaction details for via the Products, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that we are not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your BTCV transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding, or remitting any taxes arising from any BTCV tokens-related transactions.
</p>
<p>
    If, to the extent permitted by the Application, you grant express permission to a third party to access or connect to your Wallet account, either through the third party’s product or service or through the Application, you acknowledge that granting permission to a third party to take specific actions on your behalf does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under these Terms. You are fully responsible for all acts or omissions of any third party with access to your Wallet account.
