Since this app is MIT licensed, you can build it and run it on your own! Made with ReactNative


Be in control

Private keys never leave your device


Full encryption
--------------
On top of iOS multi-layer encryption, BlueWallet encrypts everything with additional user password. And yes, biometric security is not reliable


Plausible deniability
-------------------
Fake password which decrypts fake wallets. For special cases when you are forced to disclose your access, you
can disclose fake password, keeping your real coins hidden


Flexible fees
-------------
Starting from 1 Satoshi. Don't overpay for transactions


Replace-By-Fee (RBF)
----------------------
Speed-up your transactions by increasing the fee (BIP125). You can also change destination address for non-confirmed tx


SegWit
--------
SegWit supported (in P2SH-compatibility mode). Helps reduce the fees even more


Export TXHEX
--------------
Get transaction TXHEX without broadcasting it and broadcast with a relay of your choice
