## BlueWallet – Press Release/How-to Guide

## What is BlueWallet
Blue wallet is a non-custodial, Bitcoin only, wallet. This means that you, as the user with the wallet, is your own bank for your Bitcoin. Contrast this with other services where your Bitcoins are stored and monitored by a third party, BlueWallet allows you to be truly decentralized in your Bitcoin ownership.

## Why should you use BlueWallet
Apart from storing your hard-earned Bitcoins in a non-custodial, decentralized fashion, BlueWallet also provides many useful features to its users. For example, BlueWallet users have access to the Lightning network that allows the user to transact Bitcoins. This feature allows the user to ask for their transaction to be included in the next block, however, there may be a limit to how much the user is willing to pay to make this transaction. BlueWallet allows users to set their own transaction price that they are willing to pay for each transaction.

In addition to transactions, BlueWallet can also act as a monitor for your cold-storage wallets. BlueWallet offers a “watch-only” wallet that allows you to see the transactions made and wallet balances without the need to use your private key. These are some of the many useful features that is provided by the BlueWallet app.
