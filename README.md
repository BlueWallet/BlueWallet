## BUILD & RUN IT

* In your console:

```
git clone https://github.com/Overtorment/BlueWallet.git
cd BlueWallet
npm install
npm start
``` 

* Install Expo client: https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779?ct=www&mt=8
* Send the link shown in your console after `npm start` to your device
* Open the link with Safari, Expo client should automatically handle `exp://` URI scheme

## MOTIVATION TO BUILD IT

I was not satisfied with existing iOS Bitcoin apps, especially with BreadWallet (the one I mainly used) where development stalled and they could not even deliver such features as SegWit, RBF and custom fees (at the times where custom fees were especially needed).
So I knew I could create one to use myself and let others use it.
I had experience with awesome bitcoin-js lib (javascript), and since I dont own any Macs, don't plan to and not going to learn ObjC/Swift - ReactNative (where you also write in javascript) was an obvious choice.
